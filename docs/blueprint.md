# **App Name**: NeuroVichar

## Core Features:

- Neuro Synapse: Intelligently divides user prompts into subtasks and delegates them across multiple AI agents. The agents collaborate to merge outputs into a refined result, visible in a single view.
- Parallel Processing: Enables simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, enhancing overall system efficiency and responsiveness.
- Neural Interface: Accepts user intentions through an LLM-powered neural interface rather than text or voice, enabling intuitive prompt submission.
- Distributed Power Sharing: Ensures resilience with a distributed power-sharing mechanism between devices running the app
- Dynamic Sub-Prompt Decomposition: Implements dynamic sub-prompt decomposition that allows real-time collaboration among multiple AI agents and external models to synthesize unified outputs.
- Live Web Browsing Agents: Adds sandboxed live web browsing agents for real-time data and market tracking.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#003049) for a professional and intelligent feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for clean and modern interfaces.
- Accent: Electric purple (#8E2DE2) to highlight interactive elements.
- Intuitive layouts that emphasize clarity and ease of navigation.
