              <li><strong>Improved Fault Tolerance:</strong> The system could remain partially operational or assist in data recovery even if some devices go offline.</li>

              <li><strong>Efficient Resource Utilization:</strong> Workloads could be balanced across available devices, and network connectivity shared.</li>
              <li><strong>Decentralized Architecture:</strong> Aims to reduce reliance on a single point of failure for certain non-critical operations.</li>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2.5 text-muted-foreground text-base">
              <li>
                <strong>Distress Beacon:</strong> A device critically low on power (or if an SOS mode is manually triggered by the user) could attempt to broadcast a low-energy, encrypted SOS signal to nearby devices also running NeuroVichar.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Network Relay & Alert:</strong> Nearby app instances, upon securely detecting such a signal, could:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-1 space-y-1">
                    <li>Alert their users to the potential emergency and provide an approximate direction or last known location of the distressed device.</li>
                    <li>Offer to relay emergency communications (e.g., pre-defined messages, location updates) if the distressed device has lost its primary network connectivity but the assisting device has it.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Resource Pooling (Conceptual):</strong> While direct device-to-device battery transfer between arbitrary phones is generally not feasible with current standard hardware, the 'power sharing' in an SOS context refers to leveraging the collective network capabilities, processing power (for relaying messages or simple computations), and sensor data (if permitted) of nearby active devices to aid the user in distress.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Guidance to Safety/Help:</strong> If the distressed user is able, the app could guide them towards known safe locations or help points identified by the collective network.
              </li>

              This SOS feature, including any form of conceptual power or resource sharing, describes a potential future capability aiming to explore the possibilities of distributed device networks. 
              Its actual implementation would be highly dependent on significant advancements in device hardware capabilities, operating system permissions, robust security protocols, user consent mechanisms, and ethical considerations. 
              <strong>This is not a currently active feature and should not be relied upon for emergency situations. Always use official emergency channels (e.g., calling emergency services) in a crisis.</strong>
